            <h2>Abstract</h2>
        </header>
        <p>This research employed bioinformatics tools, specifically leveraging the resources of the NCBI database and BioPython, for the extraction and analysis of genomic data related to blood cancer. Through the identification of prevalent k-mers and the quantification of total mismatches, a specific k-mer sequence was pinpointed, demonstrating a significant association with cancer development. Machine learning methodologies were used to forecast the likelihood of blood cancer occurrence.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cancer is a complex disorder characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation. Blood cancer (hematologic malignancies) is one of the major threats to human health. Early and accurate identification is essential for effective treatment.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>K-mer analysis with BioPython was used to identify cancer-associated sequences. Machine learning models such as SVM and Random Forest were applied to classify the likelihood of cancer based on genomic data.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The most accurate machine learning model was Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 97%. SVM followed with 94.1%, while Naive Bayes achieved 91.2%.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This study successfully identified k-mers associated with blood cancer and used machine learning for prediction, demonstrating the potential for early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Stylistic Choices Addendum</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
            <h3>Font Choices</h3>
            <p>I chose 'Roboto', a modern, clean sans-serif font, which is widely used for professional projects due to its readability and minimalist design. It offers a balance between clarity and sophistication, suitable for academic work.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Heading and Text Sizes</h3>
            <p>The main heading (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) is set to 40px for prominence, while subheadings (<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>) are 30px, ensuring a clear hierarchy. Body text is 18px for readability, with a line-height of 1.6 to reduce eye strain during longer readings.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Color Choices</h3>
            <p>The background uses a professional gradient transitioning from light gray (#f5f5f5) to white (#ffffff), providing subtle depth without being distracting. Text is dark gray (#333333) for easy readability, and headings use a navy blue (#1a237e) for emphasis, maintaining a formal and academic tone.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Margins and Padding</h3>
            <p>The page includes consistent padding of 20px to give the content space to breathe, and the body has a margin of 40px auto to center it on larger screens. Headings and sections are given additional padding to create distinct sections without crowding.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>HTML Abuse</h3>
            <p>Initially, I used <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for the title, but this was incorrect. I replaced it with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the main title to respect proper document hierarchy. I also replaced <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for emphasis, as it semantically conveys importance.</p>
