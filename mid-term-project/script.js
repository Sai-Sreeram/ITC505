    <p>This development was accompanied by deliberate technical choices, which created an interactive and visually interesting experience while keeping the framework clean and responsive.</p>
    <p>My strategy in building the structure of HTML aimed at using semantic tags with the purpose of achieving maximum accessibility along with a smooth and consistent flow. Section tags were used in separating the story container, city map, modal elements, for clarity, as well as better navigation. Button, div, and img tags are used to maintain a layout. These aided together efficiently in the content organization and good functional elements.</p>
    <p>CSS helped me structure a uniform look and feel. In working on the colors, I used color variables to keep the color theme uniform throughout the site. This makes styling adjustments easier later on. I also used animations and button transitions to add in a certain responsiveness, creating user engagement as well-to give feedback at each turn.</p>
    <p>To emphasize the restart button located at the conclusion of each story, an overlay blur effect was employed. This technique effectively directs the user's attention to the restart option while minimizing visual distractions on the screen. Furthermore, media queries were utilized to ensure that the layout adjusts seamlessly across various device dimensions, a consideration that was prioritized to enhance accessibility and facilitate a fluid user experience.</p>
    <p>Much utilization of JavaScript went into the control of the branching paths, the choices by the user, and interactivity. I structured each step of the story as an object, where the content was text, choices, consequences, images, and addendum content in modular terms, thus being easy to add or remove or alter as needed. Functions were mainly managed in terms of event listeners, with these performing dynamic updates on the page based on the choices of the user, making it ideal for the game in terms of immersion.</p>
    <p>The challenge that I faced was to take care of smooth transitions between the stages without allowing the dynamic update of the modals from breaking the flow. Debugging these issues requires close attention to event listeners and proper state management but will, in the end, enhance project functionality and user experience.</p>
