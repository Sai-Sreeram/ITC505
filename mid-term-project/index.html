            <h2>Addendum</h2>
            <p><strong>Project Process and Creative Decisions</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Concept Development:</strong> This project's goal was to design an interactive, story-based game into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was interesting to hear the idea of a "cyber detective" storyline in a futuristic city because creativity could be explored in the design, there would be interactive choices, and the opportunity to add mini-games was there, making the project challenging and exciting at once.</p>

            <p><strong>Planning and Structure:</strong> I planned out the plot structure and various paths and endings before ever writing a line of code. I opted for a "Choose Your Own Adventure" format in which there are various stages leading to choices whose outcome determines the final ending. The stage is created as choice points where every choice led to a new stage or mini-game, and therefore having multiple endings due to the action of the user.</p>

            <p><strong>UI and Aesthetic Choices:</strong> Neon color values and glow effects in teal, pink, and dark background colors were used to immerse the viewers within an aesthetic of cyberpunk. The help of CSS animations animated the buttons, and pulsing activity on the click gave a futuristic feel to the effect. I opt for the aesthetic with the sense of a technologically advanced, digital world that would give the feel of being a cyber detective.</p>

            <p><strong>Interactivity and Game Mechanics:</strong> The game logic was managed with JavaScript. This code dynamically changed the stages and added interactivity to the user interface. The main things were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Story Stages:</strong> For each episode of the novels, an object was chosen to represent the text, choices, and consequences. Such an approach was highly flexible, allowing for expansion or modification of storyline content.</li>
                <li><strong>Mini-games:</strong> Simple puzzle challenges were interspersed to add richness to the game. For example, for decryption, the user had to input a code to continue, simulating the process of investigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Audio Elements:</strong> Background music and sound effects were used to build a more immersive environment. The music toggle helped users control the audio to suit their taste.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> I made sure the game was quite responsive, that it would work amazingly well across different devices. I used the CSS grid as well as media queries to ensure layout change so things worked correctly with buttons and content across both small and big screens.</p>

            <p><strong>Addendum Modal:</strong> As I needed to fulfill the needs of the project and be able to have a reflection space, I added an "Addendum" button, opening the modal. It then gives insight and challenges faced, thereby giving a professional feel to the project. This was my chance to explore using modal windows to take the user interface forward.</p>

            <p><strong>Challenges and Solutions</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Story Stages Management</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> It was really difficult to link multi-stage stories together initially because any choice had to lead into another stage or mini-game suitably.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I organized the stages in a JavaScript object, so now it becomes even easier to keep track of them: keys for each clearly defined stage. This structure also maintains modular and manageable code.</p>

            <p><strong>Audio Auto-play Restrictions:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Audio autoplay is disabled by default in modern browsers and breaks the immersive experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I included a flag to start music only after the first user interaction, such as clicking a button. This was a workaround and meant that the music played in line with browser policies.</p>

            <p><strong>Ensuring Uniform Design:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The consistency of colors, style of fonts, and animation throughout the elements was critical to giving it a professional look.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Replaced the use of primary colors by CSS variables, applied common animations to all buttons, and then cross-tested across all sizes of screens to be a design element.</p>

            <p><strong>Modal functionality:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Add interactivity to the Addendum modal and ensure it closes properly when clicking out of the modal area.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I added some JavaScript to close the modal when clicking outside the content. That makes it feel a lot more professional and easy to use.</p>

            <p><strong>Insights and Lessons Learned</strong></p>
            <p>This was an excellent opportunity to synthesize storytelling, design, and technical skills. It taught me how to plan and structure my code, especially where there is a branching storyline. CSS will also have a powerful role in adding visual interest to the experiences without getting too complicated. Finally, this project helped drive home the importance of design choices as both functional and fitting for the thematic goals of the project. In effect, building this game was highly exciting and really built my confidence in the handling of JavaScript for interactive applications and the use of CSS to bring life to designs.</p>

            <p>Good luck in your adventure!</p>
